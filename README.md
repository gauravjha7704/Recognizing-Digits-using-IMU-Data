# Handwritten Digit Recognition using IMU

## Project Context

This repository contains the **codebase and dataset** developed as part of the **Hackathon at the ACM India Winter School 2025 on Edge AI**, hosted by **IISc, Bengaluru**.

## Project Overview

This project presents a system for **handwritten digit recognition using motion data** instead of images.  
A **Nicla Vision** device is attached to a standard marker to capture **6-axis IMU signals**—three-axis acceleration and three-axis angular velocity—while a user writes digits on a surface.

The captured IMU time-series data is processed and classified to recognize handwritten digits, enabling a lightweight and camera-free approach to handwriting recognition suitable for **edge AI applications**.
